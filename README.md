# Universal-Media-Zero-Shot-Content-Analyzer

## Overview
This project is a modular system that analyzes uploaded videos and audio to identify speakers and languages without prior training on the specific content. It also optionally enhances video frames using super-resolution techniques.

Key technologies include zero-shot learning, ONNX model deployment on NVIDIA Triton, and workflow orchestration with Apache Airflow. The system serves as a full-stack demonstration of applied machine learning, production deployment, and media processing.

## Features
- Zero-shot speaker identification from reference audio samples
- Language identification for segments of the audio track
- Optional video super-resolution enhancement
- Scalable model deployment using ONNX and NVIDIA Triton Inference Server
- Orchestrated pipeline using Apache Airflow
- User-friendly web interface for uploading media and tracking progress

## Repository Structure
- `/models/` - Contains ONNX models and conversion scripts
- `/airflow/` - Airflow DAGs and task definitions
- `/triton/` - Triton model configurations and repository setup
- `/app/` - Backend web app code (Flask/FastAPI)
- `/data/` - Sample videos and audio for demonstration
- `/utils/` - Helper scripts for processing and inference
- `/docs/` - Project documentation (optional)
- `/tests/` - Testing scripts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+  
- Docker (for NVIDIA Triton deployment)  
- Apache Airflow  
- NVIDIA GPU with appropriate drivers (for Triton)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository  
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`  
3. Prepare ONNX models using scripts in `/models/`  
4. Launch NVIDIA Triton Server using the `/triton/` model repository  
5. Start Airflow scheduler and webserver  
6. Run the backend web app  

### Usage
- Upload a video clip and an optional reference audio through the web app UI  
- Track processing status in real-time as Airflow executes pipeline tasks  
- View detailed results including speaker timeline, languages detected, and enhanced video frames
